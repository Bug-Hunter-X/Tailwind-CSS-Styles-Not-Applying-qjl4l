# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not applying correctly despite seemingly correct configuration.  The bug and solution are provided to aid in understanding and resolving similar problems.

## Bug Description

The bug involves a situation where Tailwind CSS classes are correctly included in HTML elements, but the corresponding styles fail to render in the browser.  Standard troubleshooting steps, such as checking configuration files, running the build process, and inspecting the browser's developer tools for errors, yielded no immediate solutions.

## Solution

The issue stemmed from an unexpected conflict, likely caused by the order of CSS imports and/or an unintentional override of styles.  The solution involved thoroughly checking for conflicting CSS rules and ensuring that Tailwind CSS's styles are loaded correctly, potentially overriding any conflicting rules.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
